### Data Structure

The data folder contains the data from past seasons as well as the current season. It is structured as follows:

+ season/cleaned_players.csv : The overview stats for the season
+ season/gws/gw_number.csv : GW-specific stats for the particular season
+ season/gws/merged_gws.csv : GW-by-GW stats for each player in a single file
+ season/players/player_name/gws.csv : GW-by-GW stats for that specific player
+ season/players/player_name/history.csv : Prior seasons history stats for that specific player.

### Player Position Data

In players_raw.csv, element_type is the field that corresponds to the position.
1 = GK
2 = DEF
3 = MID
4 = FWD

### Errata

+ GW35 expected points data is wrong (all values are 0).
